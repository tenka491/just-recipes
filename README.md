# just-recipes

This is a playground for me to build with various technologies I am interested in. Maybe even have a few UIs do go with all of it.

## Node and Vue using Vite

Testing out Vite more than Vue or Node.

### Future technologies you wish to try out

These are in no particular order, they are just ones that I want to try out. Not all listed have will be used.

* EmberJs
* Ruby on Rails
* Rust
* Python / Django
* PHP something other than CodeIgniter
* Nuxt
* Tauri
* D3JS
